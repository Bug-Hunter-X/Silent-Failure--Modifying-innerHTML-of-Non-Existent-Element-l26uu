# Silent Failure in HTML: Modifying innerHTML of a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` property of a non-existent element results in a silent failure.  The JavaScript code executes without throwing an error, but the expected change to the DOM does not happen. This can be hard to debug because there's no immediate indication of the problem.

## Bug Description:
The `bug.html` file contains a `div` with the ID "myDiv". The JavaScript code attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of a `div` with the ID "myDiv2", which does not exist.  This results in no error or warning; the code simply runs without effect.

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.html` file provides a solution by first checking if the element exists before attempting to modify its `innerHTML`. This prevents the silent failure and makes the code more robust.
